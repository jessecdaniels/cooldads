### Goal: Create a website for "Cool Dads"

## Current Features 
    1. Dad Jokes: Uses fetch method to retrieve a random dad joke and display it when the "Dad Joke Button" is clicked.
    2. Dad Memes: Create array of memes, iterate over it, and display the meme in a slideshow. 
    3. Dad Tips: Creates a function that accepts a tip value, calculates a new tip on those inputs, then returns the new values; cool dad and bad dad tips
    4. Responsive website design using flexbox and media queries.

## Roadmap
    1. Clean up some of the repitation in the CSS. 
    2. A Cool Dad needs a beer. Create random beer or brewery generator.
    3. A Cool Dad needs to watch his sodium. Grab a low sodium Trader Joes items via CSV file I have.
